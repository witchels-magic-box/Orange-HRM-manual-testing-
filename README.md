# Orange-HRM-manual-testing-
Orange HRM is a human resource management (HRM) application. It is accessible to the admins who are HR managers from the admin end, and to employees from the ESS user end. I personally started testing a module of the web-application which is the My Info module under the ESS user. I read and analyzed the FRS document and Test plan documentation thoroughly and prepared my test strategies. Following the documentations I prepared the test scenarios, test cases. Executed the test cases and generated bug report. Next I prepared my Project Documentation. From completing this project I have learnt about the Test Document Preparations, Got clear ideas about Test Plan document and Test Strategy. Got an opportunity to complete the project by following the test cycle orders. Performed Smoke testing, Sanity testing and progression testing.
